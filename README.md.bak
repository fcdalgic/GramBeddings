# Overview

The name *Grambeddings*   comes from the N-gram Embeddings. Grambeddings a novel and scalable deep learning model that is specialized to to recognize malicious websites from a given URL by employing both character and multiple n-gram embeddings in parallel sub-networks.  The suggested network model contains CNN, LSTM, and Attention (CLA) architecture to extract discriminative syntactical and temporal features to obtain high performance in terms of accuracy.

This repository contains the original implementation of the paper named "Grambeddings: An End-To-EndNeural Model for Phishing URL-Classification Through N-Gram Embeddings"
