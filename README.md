# GramBeddings

This repository contains the original implementation of the paper named "Grambeddings:  An End-To-EndNeural Model for Phishing URL-Classification  Through  N-Gram Embeddings"

In order to download the proposed dataset please check the following link and paste it under the "/data/grambeddings" folder; https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/grambeddings-dataset/

This repository is currently under maintenance, and we are preparing a detailed explanation of the project structure and a brief overview of the proposed algorithm. It should be available before November 18th. If you need to contact me, you can reach me from [here](firatcoskundalgic@gmail.com "here") . I appreciate your patience.
